We start with the carefully filtered data on protein complexes available for\r\n_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database.\r\nFirst, we build linear descriptions of interacting and non-interacting sequence segment pairs based\r\non their inter-residue distances. Secondly, we train machine learning / to predict binary\r\nsegment interactions for any two short sequence fragments.\r\nThe final prediction of the protein-protein interaction is done using the 2D matrix representation\r\nof all-against-all possible interacting sequence segments of both analysed proteins. The\r\nlevel-I predictor achieves 0.88 AUC for micro-scale, i.e. **residue-level** prediction.\r\nThe level-II predictor improves the results further by more complex learning paradigm.\r\nWe perform 30-fold macro-scale, i.e. **protein-level** cross-validation experiment.\r\nThe level-II predictor using PSIPRED-predicted secondary structure reaches 0.70 precision, 0.68 recall, and 0.70 AUC, whereas other popular\r\nmethods provide results below 0.6 threshold (recall, precision, AUC). Our results\r\ndemonstrate that multi-scale sequence features aggregation procedure is able to improve\r\nthe machine learning results by more than 10% as compared to other sequence representations.\r\n\r\n### Content\r\n\r\nThe repository contains full source code of the experimental pipeline.
