<p>Accurate identification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is the key step in
understanding proteins' biological functions, which are typically context-dependent.
Many existing PPI predictors rely on aggregated features from protein sequences,
however only a few methods exploit local information about specific residue contacts.</p>

<p>In this work we present a two-stage machine learning approach for prediction of protein-protein
interactions. We start with the carefully filtered data on protein complexes available for
<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database.
First, we build linear descriptions of interacting and non-interacting sequence segment pairs based
on their inter-residue distances. Secondly, we train machine learning / to predict binary
segment interactions for any two short sequence fragments.
The final prediction of the protein-protein interaction is done using the 2D matrix representation
of all-against-all possible interacting sequence segments of both analysed proteins. The
level-I predictor achieves 0.88 AUC for micro-scale, i.e. <strong>residue-level</strong> prediction.
The level-II predictor improves the results further by more complex learning paradigm.
We perform 30-fold macro-scale, i.e. <strong>protein-level</strong> cross-validation experiment.
The level-II predictor using PSIPRED-predicted secondary structure reaches 0.70 precision, 0.68 recall, and 0.70 AUC, whereas other popular
methods provide results below 0.6 threshold (recall, precision, AUC). Our results
demonstrate that multi-scale sequence features aggregation procedure is able to improve
the machine learning results by more than 10% as compared to other sequence representations.</p>
